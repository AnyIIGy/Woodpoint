## Initial Functionality: Watch Selection and Purchase Page

This page serves as the starting point for our watch selection and purchasing feature. Users can explore a range of watches, apply filters to refine their choices, add watches to their cart, and proceed to checkout. Key functionalities implemented include:

- **Watch Selection:** Users can browse through a variety of watch options, each with detailed descriptions and images.

- **Filtering Options:** Users can apply filters to narrow down their search based on criteria like brand, price range, and style.

- **Cart Management:** Users can add watches to their cart, view their selected items, and adjust quantities before proceeding to checkout.

- **Address Input:** During checkout, users can provide their shipping address for order delivery.

This initial functionality establishes the core features required for users to explore and purchase watches on our platform. Future iterations will build upon this foundation, incorporating additional features and enhancements.
